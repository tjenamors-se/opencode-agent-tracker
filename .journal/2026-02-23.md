## 18:00
- **Task**: Write SPECS.md for database configuration fixes
- **Actions taken**: Explored full codebase, identified two bugs (no mapSize, unresolved ~ path), gathered user requirements
- **Outcome**: Requirements locked, writing SPECS.md
- **Decisions made**: Phase 1 spec-agent workflow; three changes scoped (size cap, central path, migration)

## 18:30
- **Task**: Update SPECS.md with write batching and excellence grade
- **Actions taken**: Analyzed tracking-service.ts write pattern (4+ writes per commit cycle), added R6 (buffer writes, flush on push) and R7 (excellence grade +5)
- **Outcome**: Success, SPECS.md committed with 7 requirements total
- **Decisions made**: Flush safety net on session.deleted, not just push. Excellence at +5 to differentiate from Good (+2) meaningfully.

## 19:00
- **Task**: Write BRAINSTORM.md for R1-R7 architectural strategies
- **Actions taken**: Analyzed 3 strategies (minimal patch, buffer layer, full abstraction), identified 9 edge cases, assessed 6 risks
- **Outcome**: Success, recommended Strategy B (buffer layer + config object)
- **Decisions made**: Strategy C rejected due to read-your-writes complexity. Strategy A rejected due to weak atomicity and untestable buffer. E7 (`:memory:` guard) flagged as high-priority edge case. E9 (buffer key collision) resolved with read-once-mutate-in-memory approach.

## 19:30
- **Task**: Update SPECS.md with R8 (agent state management via TrackingService)
- **Actions taken**: Identified Bug 4 (state managed via cat/EOF), added R8 with 5 sub-requirements (R8.1-R8.5), extended affected files and validation criteria
- **Outcome**: Success, SPECS.md now has 8 requirements. LMDB becomes single source of truth for all agent state.
- **Decisions made**: Project-local files (.agent/status.json, .journal/) become optional read-only exports from LMDB, not the source of truth. Grade type shared across R7 and R8.

## 20:00
- **Task**: Rewrite BRAINSTORM.md v2 with LMDB 3.x deep research
- **Actions taken**: Researched full LMDB npm API (sharedStructuresKey, sub-databases, ifNoExists, useVersions, transactions, prefetch, cache, events, flushed). Designed 3 strategies incorporating advanced features. Added 6 new edge cases (E10-E15).
- **Outcome**: Success. Strategy B (sub-databases) recommended. Sub-dbs eliminate prefix scanning, enable per-type structural sharing, make R8 natural, and provide cross-db atomic transactions for free.
- **Decisions made**: Strategy C (optimistic locking) deferred to post-Phase 1 -- risk of concurrent sessions too low to justify complexity. ifNoExists() chosen for migration over manual check-then-put. sharedStructuresKey per sub-db for maximum compression.
