- **Task**: Write SPECS.md for database configuration fixes
- **Actions taken**: Explored full codebase, identified two bugs (no mapSize, unresolved ~ path), gathered user requirements
- **Outcome**: Requirements locked, writing SPECS.md
- **Decisions made**: Phase 1 spec-agent workflow; three changes scoped (size cap, central path, migration)

## 18:30
- **Task**: Update SPECS.md with write batching and excellence grade
- **Actions taken**: Analyzed tracking-service.ts write pattern (4+ writes per commit cycle), added R6 (buffer writes, flush on push) and R7 (excellence grade +5)
- **Outcome**: Success, SPECS.md committed with 7 requirements total
- **Decisions made**: Flush safety net on session.deleted, not just push. Excellence at +5 to differentiate from Good (+2) meaningfully.
